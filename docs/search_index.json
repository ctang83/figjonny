Mathematics Methods focuses on the use of calculus and statistical analysis. The study of calculus provides a basis for understanding rates of change in the physical world, and includes the use of functions, their derivatives and integrals, in modelling physical processes. The study of statistics develops students ability to describe and analyse phenomena that involve uncertainty and variation. Mathematics Applications focuses on financial modelling, geometric and trigonometric analysis, graphical and network analysis, growth, decay in sequences, statistical questions that involve univariate, bivariate data, time series data. Applications is designed for students who want to extend their mathematical skills beyond Year 10 level, but whose future studies or employment pathways do not require knowledge of calculus, including continuing their studies at university or TAFE.
